## Moment

According to Wikipedia, a *moment* is a "specific quantitative measure of the shape of a function".
If the function is a probability distribution, then:

* the first *raw moment* is the *mean* $\mu$.
* the second *central moment* is the *variance* $\sigma^2$, i.e. the square of the *standard deviation*.

Note that *variance* is called *дисперсия* in Russian. Do not confuse it with the *coefficient of variation*,
defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, $c_v = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}$.

## Probability distribution fitting

The appropriate distribution for a series can be determined based on $c_v$:

* $c_v = 0$ indicates the *degenerate distribution*.

* $0 < c_v < 1$ indicates the *hypoexponential distribution*, which is a general case of the *Erlang distribution*. The latter is easier to estimate the parameters for ($k \geqslant \frac{1}{c_v^2}$), and it's the one we'll see in the test problems.

* $c_v = 1$ indicates the *exponential distribution*.

* $c_v > 1$ indicates the *hyperexponential distribution*.

### Example tasks

> Find the closest fitting distribution for a series given the first raw moment is 10 and the second central moment is 4.

In other words, $\mu = 10$, $\sigma^2 = 4$, implying $c_v = \frac{\sqrt{4}}{10} = 0.2$, which is more than 0 and less than 1. Pick the Erlang distribution: $k = \frac{1}{0.2^2} = 25$.

> Find the closest fitting distribution for a series given the first raw moment is 4 and the second raw moment is 24.

The second central moment ($\sigma^2$) can also be computed as the second raw moment - (the first raw moment)^2: $\sigma^2 = 24 - \mu^2 = 24 - 4^2 = 8$

$c_v = \frac{\sqrt{8}}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$. Seeing that $0 < c_v < 1$, we can conclude this is the Erlang distribution as well. $k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}^2} = 2$.
